(4) Intentional misconduct.--The term ``intentional misconduct'' means conduct by a person with knowledge (at the time of the conduct) that the conduct is harmful to the health or well-being of another person. (5) Nonprofit organization.--The term ``nonprofit organization'' means-- (A) any organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from tax under section 501(a) of such Code; or (B) any not-for-profit organization organized and conducted for public benefit and operated primarily for charitable, civic, educational, religious, welfare, or health purposes. (6) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, any other territory or possession of the United States, or any political subdivision of any such State, territory, or possession.

(2) Application.--This subsection shall apply-- (A) with respect to civil liability under Federal and State law; and (B) regardless of whether a nonprofit organization pays for the use of a facility. (c) Exception for Liability.--Subsection (b) shall not apply to an injury or death that results from an act or omission of a business entity that constitutes gross negligence or intentional misconduct, including any misconduct that-- (1) constitutes a crime of violence (as that term is defined in section 16 of title 18, United States Code) or act of international terrorism (as that term is defined in section 2331 of title 18) for which the defendant has been convicted in any court; (2) constitutes a hate crime (as that term is used in the Hate Crime Statistics Act (28 U.S.C. 534 note)); (3) involves a sexual offense, as defined by applicable State law, for which the defendant has been convicted in any court; or (4) involves misconduct for which the defendant has been found to have violated a Federal or State civil rights law.
